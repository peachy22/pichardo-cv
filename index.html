Thank you for taking the time to visit my portfolio website! 
  </br></br>
I'm a data engineer and entrepreneur. My interests extend from database administration and ETL pipeline development, to optimizing the various communication layers used by stakeholders to make informed decisions. This website displays some of the explorations I've performed over my career and for personal enrichment. 
  </br></br>
I began developing it from scratch when I realized my old blog wasn't cutting it in terms of the scope I wanted to engage with. The blog's contents, mostly focused on data science and machine learning models, were brought over to the <a href="/pichardo-cv/blog/index.html">legacy projects</a> page.
</br></br>
I'm more interested lately in larger-scale explorations that illuminate how modern organizations engage with data and AI. To that end, I made the <a href="/pichardo-cv/blog/index.html">business intelligence</a> landing page.
</br></br>
I am currently open to employment opportunities where aggressive innovation, nuanced communication, and keen business insight will be valued. For questions and a full CV, please reach out to me at <a href=mailto:“stephan.pichardo@protonmail.com”>stephan.pichardo@protonmail.com</a>.
